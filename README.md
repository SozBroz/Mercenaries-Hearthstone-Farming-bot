This is a bot to farm Hearthstone mercenaries coins by grinding Heroic Ferocious Quilboar, and can collect tasks by farming Normal Lord Banehollow.

This worked on my computer using a full screen 1920 by 1080p monitor.

You might have to retake screenshots of the icons, and as they add new characters you will have to add screenshots of their icons.

This game mode stopped being of interest to me so I don't plan on making any further changes.

The bulk of the code is in main.py.

This was used to max out multiple characters using this free to play method.
